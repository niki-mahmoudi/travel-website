## How to use? ##
Please download python flask, mysql connector and activate the `venv` using the `python3 -m venv venv` command (this command is specific to macos so please choose the command based on your own OS). 
You may install these commands before running the `main.py` file:

`pip install flask`                   # for everything under flask
`pip install python-dateutil`         # for dateutil.relativedelta

`pip install passlib`                 # for passlib.hash.sha256_crypt
`pip install reportlab`

You can access the database using the **sql-setup** folder.

## Admin information used for demo ##
Admin email:    `niki@outlook.com`
